## Overview

`pureharm-movie-server` is an educational project which shows _one_ way of writing an application web server in pure functional Scala using the [typelevel](https://github.com/typelevel/) ecosystem. Most heavy lifting is done by all the libraries.

It assumes no knowledge of Scala, nor of web-server development, nor of pure functional programming. The documentation aims to be as comprehensive as possible (on a need to know basis, e.g. we will not talk about `SelectDynamic` Scala feature, because we simply don't rely on it), provide relevant links to learning materials to help you fill any gaps.
